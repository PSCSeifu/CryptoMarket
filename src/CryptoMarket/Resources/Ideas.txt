Affliatesthese are clients - customers

Vendors can have Affliates
Affliates - are like clients bu don't have access to the site out side of the Vendor
		- they are crated,edited,deleted by Vendors
		- Vendors can give them differne status and previlege to perform services
		- aflfiates can buy,sell,exchange depending on the vendors permission
		- Affliates can get perks like loss wallets
		- Vendors would set differnet profit sharing schems and let them use automated services like 
		  haggling AI's etc
The rational for Affliates is creative offer schemes, more obeservant and very transient offers can be
made by indiviuals than large vendors.


Affliates would need a separe login  with {VendorName, Affliateusername, affliate password}
Vendors can become affliates but a certain limit would be set on their membership
depding on their vendor status with the website (i.e. they must pay the site more for previelges)
